I am an ARC DECRA fellow in mathematics at the University of Queensland, affiliated with the <i>Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics</i> (CARM), the <i>Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science</i> (CBCS), and the <i>Centre for Marine Science</i> (CMS). Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in theoretical ecology, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management. I am especially interested in research related to overexploitation and sustainable harvest of biological populations, from fisheries management to illegal wildlife trade.

I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner, where I worked on the optimal management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.

<i>Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade</i>

Illegal harvest and trade of wildlife products are ideal case studies for studying social-ecological systems. Even the simplest two dimensional systems of ordinary differential equation models of harverst can produce a rich set of population dynamics when accounting for the motivations of individual harvesters and traders. Conservation scientists have started using these models to inform policy to protect species against poaching and illegal trade. Models with specific functional forms can produce dramatic bifurcations, with small changes in parameters or initial conditions driving healthy populations extinct. Yet, for these models, the mathematical rules that govern when different types of dynamics are possible are poorly undertstood. This can be disasterous, as it can be hard to determine whether complicated dynamics produced by such models are simply the result of numerical error, coding bugs, or are genuinely the mechanistic driver of how populations change through time. One of my on-going lines of research is to develop rigorous mathematical descriptions of population dynamics of harvested species within much broader classes of mathematical models. 


<i>Fisheries Management, Model Complexity</i>

More than 99.8% of fisheries are assessed using single-species models. Since humans harvest multiple interacting species, not considering these interactions can lead to negative outcomes that reduce food security, eliminate human livelihoods, decrease economic production, and harm the environment. This project aims to quantify the benefits of using multi-species syestems of ordinary differential equations for harvest decisions. Expected outcomes of the project include 1) guidance for fisheries scientists on when to use multi-species models for management, 2) improved decision making to reduce the risk of fishery collapse, 3) a new method for dynamic model validation in the face of limited data.


<i>Fishery Sock Assessments</i>

I regularly apply mathematical and statistical theory to on the ground fisheries management problems in collaboration with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF), and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). For example I performed the first stock assessment of coral trout, a collection of species (<i>Plectropomus leopardus</i>, <i>P. maculatus</i>, <i>P. laevis</i>), in the Torres Strait. Most of my fisheries management work focusses on methods for data-poor fisheries where the status of the fish stock is highly uncertain.
