I am a lecturer and research fellow at the University of Queensland with joint appointments in the <i>Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics</i> (CARM) and the <i>ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions </i> (CEED). Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in environmental science. I am especially interested in (1) understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems and (2) evaluating the efficacy of quantitative approaches to natural resource management.

I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner, where I worked on the optimal management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.
