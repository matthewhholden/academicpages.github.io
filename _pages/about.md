I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Queensland's ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED) in Brisbane, Australia. Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in environmental science, including illegal use and trade of natural resources, fisheries management, NGO and stakeholder behaviour, and invasive species management.


I am especially interested in (1) understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems, where conservation policy affects human behaviour and (2) evaluating the efficacy of quantitative approaches to natural resource management.


I did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner,  where I worked on the optimal management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.
