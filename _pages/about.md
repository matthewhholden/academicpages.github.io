I am an ARC DECRA fellow in mathematics at the University of Queensland, affiliated with the <i>Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics</i> (CARM), the <i>Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science</i> (CBCS), and the <i>Centre for Marine Science</i> (CMS). Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in theoretical ecology, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management. I am especially interested in research related to overexploitation and sustainable harvest of biological populations, from fisheries management to illegal wildlife trade.

I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner, where I worked on the optimal management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.

<b>Fisheries Management and Marine Reserves</b>

<b>Fishery Sock Assessments</b>
I regularly apply mathematical and statistical theory to on the ground fisheries management problems in collaboration with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF), and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). For example I performed the first stock assessment of coral trout, a collection of species (<i>Plectropomus leopardus</i>, <i>P. maculatus</i>, <i>P. laevis</i>), in the Torres Strait. Most of my fisheries management work focusses on methods for data-poor fisheries where the status of the fish stock is highly uncertain.
