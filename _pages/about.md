I am a ARC DECRA fellow in mathematics at the University of Queensland, affiliated with the <i>Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics</i> (CARM), the <i>Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science</i> (CBCS), and the <i>Centre for Marine Science</i> (CMS). Mathematical tools unify my research across several diverse topics in theoretical ecology, biodiversity conservation, and natural resource management. I am especially interested in research related to overexploitation and sustainable harvest of biological populations, from fisheries management to illegal wildlife trade.

I completed my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, advised by Stephen Ellner, where I worked on the optimal management of invasive species, agricultural pests, and fisheries.
